'''
Monitors the current time and starts the appropriate parts of the routine OR executes simulations up until the current
date.

The schedule is as follows (in New York time):

16:15: retrieve the current data for the past trading day. Use it to generate training data and set up an
ensemble Neural Network Estimator, trained on data from the whole last year.

14:00: call for action from the user: sell all stocks, and then enter the current balance into the program. It will be
automatically converted into USD. Then generate a plot to visualize the overall success of the investment strategy

14:15: gather the data from the current day (9:00 - 14:00), and use it to retrain the ensemble estimator. Select an
investment strategy, and calculate which and how many stocks the user should buy. The output is written to the
STRATEGY.txt file.
